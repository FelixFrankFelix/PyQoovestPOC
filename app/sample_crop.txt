Nitrogen Adjustment Recommendation

Current Soil Status:
- Nitrogen (N): [Current Level] ppm
- Nitrogen Change : [Nitrogen Deficit] ppm

Optimal Level for [Crop Name]:
- Nitrogen (N): [Optimal Level] ppm

Recommendation:
To raise/drop the nitrogen level from [Current Level] ppm to the optimal level of [Optimal Level] ppm for [Crop Name], follow these steps:
