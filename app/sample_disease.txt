Cause
- Fungal Infection: Caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans, often thriving in wet and cool conditions.
- Moisture: Prolonged leaf wetness from rain, irrigation, or high humidity promotes the spread of the disease.

Remedies
- Fungicide Application: Apply a copper-based fungicide or other recommended fungicides at the first sign of infection to prevent the disease from spreading.
- Cultural Practices: Ensure proper spacing between plants for air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and remove any infected leaves or plants immediately to reduce the spread of the fungus.
